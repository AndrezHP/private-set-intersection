/* TODO

[] better test suite, maybe?
[] Create two test suites for unbalanced data samples and balanced data samples?

[] split hash and op to remove unnecessary branching

[/] Unbalanced with different key for each element? Unbalanced w/o key for each element? (Keeping it for report)

[] Change the bench script to fit with data table entries

Backlog for the rapport:
[] Write about the unbalanced protocol

Balanced:
Server/Client
2^12
2^14
2^16
2^20

Unbalanced:
Server:
2^18
2^20
2^22

Client:
2^10
2^12

size(server) >> size(client)
